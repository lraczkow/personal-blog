         <h2>Embrace the Chaos</h2>
         <hr />
         <h3>June 17, 2019</h3>
         <p>
           We’ve all heard the phrase, “Life is a journey. Just enjoy the ride.” Well, for nearly 15 years I have been journeying. As much as I want to say I’m ready for it to stop, I’m not quite sure that is true.
         </p>
         <p>
           When I started taking full-time college courses my junior year of high school, I was crystal clear that I wanted to go into the IT field. Fast forward 2 years as I entered a 4-year institution at 17 as a second semester sophomore. I sat in my first higher level computer programming class and looked around at everyone else in the room at thought “What am I doing here? I don’t belong here. I’m not like these guys. I’m a fraud and they will all find out.” That was the beginning of my extended journey.
         </p>
         <p>
           Between that moment in 2006 and today in 2019, I watched the economy crash just before I graduated, I graduated with a degree in business and marketing, I became a nanny, I was introduced to a career in health care, I graduated with my masters degree in occupational therapy, I have moved between 4 different states chasing different job opportunities.
         </p>
         <p>
           Life has been chaotic.
         </p>
         <p>
           Ironically enough, here I am 15 years from the moment I chose to work with computers actually becoming educated in computers — however, I finally have the confidence and belief in myself to complete it. It may have taken me a roundabout way to get back here, but that’s the beauty of life.
         </p>
         <p>
           We all have different experiences and journeys that our lives take us on. Personally, I believe each of those have a precise meaning that has led us to where we are now. Within these last few years, I have learned to laugh with the chaos, listen to my intuition, and follow my soul.
         </p>
         <p>
           Here’s the thing, I am bored with my current career. Coding and web development challenges my brain in ways that it hasn’t been in years. This, is where I belong. This, was my calling.
         </p>
         <p>
           This program has been anything less than easy. There have been many moments that I want to throw in the towel after a sob fest to my husband. Each and every time this happens, I focus on why I began this; I look back on everything I have already accomplished; I look forward to all the potential that this can bring to my family.
         </p>
         <p>
           Life has been chaotic. But I choose every day to embrace the chaos.
